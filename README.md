This project has been the first ""big"" website I've ever built (at least that's what it felt like to me when I was 15 ðŸ˜…). The best part is that it started as a ripoff of Agar.io (it's a web game) and the website was just a beta for accounts of this game.

I've always kept this repository private but it doesn't need to be that way anymore. I used to save database passwords and hash salts hardcoded in PHP files, and I used to commit those to the repository. It is now obvious to me that I shouldn't have worked that way, so please keep it in mind when you see hardcoded strings and other bad practices :)
